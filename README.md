**Welcome to the Build-it-yourself CMD HD-4000 support github site**

It is here where you're going to find the information you need to complete the build of your reproduction CMD HD-4000.  The build-it-yourself "kit" includes the main pcb, display/button board pcb, 3 GALS (U13, U24, U27) and HD BOOTROM v2.80.  The GALS and Bootrom are license (licensing fee is included in the cost of the parts kit).  No other components are included.  The BOM (bill of materials) found on this site will supply you with a list of all the components you need to purchase as well as (for the most part) links to where you may find them to order.  Keep in mind that your location on the planet may dictate where you end up buying your parts from.  IE: if you're in Italy, it doesn't neccessarily make sense to order your electronics components from Canada.  You will make the determination for yourself.  Optionally, you may also choose to buy the label set for your HD build.

This is a moderate difficulty build.  Experience soldering and debugging issues is something that you'll be taking on for yourself.  If this seems too daunting, then perhaps get a friend with those skills to solder it up for you and do the preliminary testing.

With respect to the case, there are two designs available.  The first is a 3D printable version of the case.  This case is print compatible FDM style printers as well as resin printers.  You will be able to order the 3D printed case directly from PCBWay.  Links will be provided here soon.  The second case style that will be available is a reproduction of the original metal case.  This case will also be available for order through PCBWay.  Link swill be provided here soon as well.  The last option will be for you to print the case yourself.  STL's will be made available for single use purchase through the COREi64.com website.  There you'll be able to purchase the right to print one CMD HD case.  Once purchased, the STL files will be e-mailed to you.

This github will evolve as more information becomes available or is requested.
